First day where haskell was a real struggle: super strong typing makes parsing difficult. On the other hand, pythons loosely typed list coupled with `eval`
made parsing fairly straightforward. After that just simple pattern matching.

Correct return vals for comp fn from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5213033/sort-a-list-of-lists-with-a-custom-compare-function


Might come back and use rusts iters (super nice way when you reach end of iter) but suspect typing might be issue as well.
